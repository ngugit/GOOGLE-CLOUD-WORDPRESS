//Google Cloud FTP Setup with FileZilla 
//There are 7 steps in this tutorial:
1. Download PuTTY and FileZilla

2. Generate SSH Keys

3. Copy and save the keys
After your SSH Key files have been generated, copy the public key text from the top box,
and download the private key file by clicking the “Save private key” button.

4. Paste Public Key in Google Cloud
From the hamburger menu in the upper left-hand corner of your Google Cloud Platform dashboard, 
navigate to Compute Engine > Metadata > SSH Keys. Click the “Edit” button.
Scroll to the bottom of the “Edit” page, click the “Add item” button, 
and paste the Public Key text that you copied in Step 3 into the box. Finally, click “Save”.

5. Upload Private Key in FileZilla
Open FileZilla, and navigate to Edit > Settings.
From the left-hand column of the settings menu, navigate to Connection > FTP > SFTP. 
Click the “Add key file…” button, and select the private key file that you downloaded in Step 3.

6. Establish Connection to Google Cloud

In order to establish a connection between Google Cloud and Filezilla, you will need both the IP Address to your instance, 
and the username for your SSH Key.

Back in the FileZilla dashboard, type “sftp://” followed by the IP Address of the instance you wish to connect to. In the username field, 
paste your PuTTY username.
Lastly, click the “Quickconnect” button.

7. Navigate to your root directory

If you’re running the Click-to-Deploy version of WordPress on Google Cloud, your root directory is located at:/var/www/html
